# This is the FC (Free Convection) experiment from Van Roekel et al. (2018)

## Forcing parameters

Sensible Heat Flux = - 75 W/m2

SW Heat Flux (peak) = 0 W/m2

Evaporation = 0 mm/day

Wind stress = 0 N/m2

Rotation: f = 1e-4 s-1

## Initial profile

Temperature profile: T(Z) = 20 [degC] + 0.01 [degC/m] * Z [m]

Salinity profile:    S(Z) = 35 g/kg
