# This is the CEW (Cooling, evaporation, wind) experiment from Van Roekel et al. (2018)

## Forcing parameters

Sensible Heat Flux = - 75 W/m2
SW Heat Flux = 0 W/m2
Evaporation = 1.37 mm/day
Wind stress = 0.1 N/m2 (x-direction)
Rotation: f = 1e-4 s-1

## Initial profile

Temperature profile: T(Z) = 20 [degC] + 0.01 [degC/m] * Z [m]
Salinity profile:    S(Z) = 35 g/kg
