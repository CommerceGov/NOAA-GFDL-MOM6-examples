# This is the FCE (Free Convection Evaporation) experiment from Van Roekel et al. (2018)

## Forcing parameters

Sensible Heat Flux = 0 W/m2
SW Heat Flux (peak) = 0 W/m2
Evaporation = 1.37 mm/day
Wind stress = 0 N/m2
Rotation: f = 1e-4 s-1

## Initial profile

Temperature profile: T(Z) = 20 [degC]
Salinity profile:    S(Z) = 35 g/kg - 0.007813 [g/kg/m] * Z [m]
